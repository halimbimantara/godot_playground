# Godot Playground!

This is my personal playground with a bunch of code, snipets small projects and everything that I make with Godot Engine.

## Can I copy any of this?

All the things in this repository is free to use. Most of the code, sprites and everything are free online so you can get a official copy by yourself. (or copy from this repository if you are lazy)

## Can I play this games? 

The published version should be somewhere on the [Itch.io](https://itch.io), it's easy to find.

## Can you tell me something about the projects it self?

Yeah, just PM me on the twitter or mail me.
